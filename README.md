# NestGraph iOS

This is a companion application to the Ruby on Rails application [of the same name](https://github.com/NiallBegley/nestgraph).  Data is pulled down from the rails server, stored in core data, and displayed in a quick summary view on the main screen.  You can also view charts for each device (via [Charts](https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts)).
